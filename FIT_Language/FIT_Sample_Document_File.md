## Nutrition Dynamics
### Science of Macros
	Carb storage > break in glucose > if it is more than body's energy expendature store in muscle > store in liver > Run out of storage, store as body fat.
	Carbohydrate produce energy. 
	Protein makes muscle tissues, bones and soft tissue strong, engyme and big role in producing hormone, antibodies and immune system made of protein.
	Fat produces energy, bile(breakdown fat) and bile extract fat soluable vitamin micros. That's how it is critical for digestion.
	Eicosanoids are hormone-like substances necessary for normal cell function and inflamation regulation(from mental and physical stress). Eicosanoids are produced by fats from your diet.
	That's why ketosis and fasting are more effective in using body fat for fighting inflamation.

	When they burn, they produce, 
	Vitamin needed for mineral absorption
	Carb - 4 cal
	prot - 4 cal
	Fat - 9 cal
	protein gravitates water.
	insulin important in fat loss.
	Carbohydrate produces energy to extract amino acid from protein. And Protein produces engyme to break down carbohydrate. 

	Generally, your body burns glycogen stores in the muscle, then it uses stored fat to make glucose to send them in muscle to use. If it takes extremely longer and continuous workout or starving, it breaks protein. So,if you need to cut body fat and gain muscle,take carbs energy little lower according to exercise, so you can use energy to break muscle, that will make muscle bigger when you will eat and take rest. little lower carb will make calorie deficit, which will be fullfilled from bodyfat. That's how you can gain muscle and cut fat in the same time.
